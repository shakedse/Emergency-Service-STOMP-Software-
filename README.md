This project simulates a detailed reconstruction strategy for post-war areas. 
I developed a C++ program that manages and simulates different reconstruction plans, each prioritizing settlements and rebuilding efforts differently. 
The program defines several strategies, such as choosing whether to construct schools or office buildings, and runs simulations to assess the long-term impact of these decisions on the overall recovery.
